# A game of Tic Tac Toe

Build using [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) components, [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and a Game engine build in [ES6 classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes).

installation (you need to have node.js installed for this):

run:
```
npm install
```

After installation make sure you have [`gulp`](http://gulpjs.com/) installed in the global namespace:

```
npm install gulp-cli -g
```

then run in the project's root:
```
gulp
```
This will build the Sass and ES6 classes into plain CSS and JavaScript.

Open up index.html in your browser and the game should run.
